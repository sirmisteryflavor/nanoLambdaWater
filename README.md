<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
nanoLambda is a digital spectrometer company (website). A spectrometer is a scientific instrument that measures absorption rate of light as it passes through a material. The interesting characteristic is that each chemical compound has a unique fingerprint in that it absorbs the same amount of light as it passes through which allows observers to identify the chemical composition of a given solution. nanoLambdaâ€™s digital spectrometer can provide this absorption measurements in real-time with unusually high accuracy as opposed to traditional analog spectrometers which can take weeks. This allows anyone to take spectroscopic measurements on-site in real-time, continuously.</p>
<br>
<p>
In this sample dataset, an academic research team in India went out and tested a series of water samples from different regions collecting the absorption data. The team then sent the water samples to a lab where measurements of different chemical compounds (i.e. Nitrate, Nitrite, Calcium, etc.) and characteristics (pH, hardness, etc.) were measured.

<h5>Goal</h5>
<p>Build a predictive model that can accurately predict safety level of Nitrate (<= 10mg / L)</p>
